# Month-End Close Checklist

Run the month-end close checklist, compute financial statements, and flag issues.

**Backend: e-arveldaja only.** This workflow drives the month-end checklist, document audit, and financial statements, which other ledger backends do not expose. In a ledger session (e-arveldaja unconfigured), tell the user it needs e-arveldaja credentials and stop — do not improvise an equivalent with `ledger_*` tools.

**Input:** Month in YYYY-MM format (e.g. `2026-02`).

User-facing phases:
1. Identify close blockers.
2. Check missing documents and duplicate invoices.
3. Compute statements.
4. Show READY TO CLOSE or HAS BLOCKERS with concrete inline next actions.

## Step 1: Run the checklist

If the user says they recently changed data in the e-arveldaja web UI or asks for fresh numbers, call `clear_cache` before running the checklist and statements.

Call `month_end_close_checklist`:
- `month`: YYYY-MM value
- `fresh`: true if the user asked for fresh data and you did not already call `clear_cache`

## Step 2: Flag blocking issues

Present in priority order:

**BLOCKERS (must fix before closing):**
1. Unconfirmed purchase invoices — not registered in the ledger
2. Unconfirmed sale invoices — revenue not recorded
3. Unconfirmed journal entries — adjustments not posted
4. Unconfirmed bank transactions — cash not reconciled

For blockers, show ID, date, amount/title, then offer concrete inline actions. If there are many blockers of the same low-risk type, show the first 10 plus counts and ask one batch approval with exceptions instead of one yes/no question per item. Do NOT close the workflow with "go fix these in the e-arveldaja UI". That is a last-resort fallback only when no MCP tool can perform the action and the API has already rejected the inline attempt.

Inline actions per blocker type:
- Purchase invoices: offer `confirm_purchase_invoice`, or `delete_purchase_invoice` if the user confirms it is a duplicate
- Sale invoices: offer `confirm_sale_invoice`
- Journals: offer `confirm_journal`
- Transactions: prefer the **Reconcile Bank** workflow for unmatched rows; for already-matched single rows offer `confirm_transaction` directly

**WARNINGS (review but may not block close):**
- Overdue receivables — may need follow-up or doubtful debt provision
- Overdue payables — check if payment was made but not yet recorded

## Step 3: Check for missing documents

Call `find_missing_documents`:
- `date_from`: YYYY-MM-01
- `date_to`: last day of the month

Report confirmed purchase invoices without attached PDFs — these need supporting documents for audit compliance.

## Step 4: Check for duplicate invoices

Call `detect_duplicate_purchase_invoice`:
- `date_from`: YYYY-MM-01
- `date_to`: last day of the month

Report exact duplicates (same supplier + invoice number) and suspicious matches (same supplier + amount + date with different numbers).

## Step 5: Compute financial statements

Call `compute_trial_balance`:
- `date_from`: YYYY-MM-01
- `date_to`: last day of the month
- `fresh`: true if the user asked for fresh data and you did not already call `clear_cache`

Verify total debits = total credits. Treat sub-cent rounding deltas (under 0.01 EUR) as acceptable in multi-currency books; anything larger is a blocker that needs investigation.

Call `compute_profit_and_loss`:
- `date_from`: YYYY-01-01 (fiscal year start)
- `date_to`: last day of the month
- `fresh`: true if the user asked for fresh data and you did not already call `clear_cache`

Show YTD P&L: total revenue, total expenses, net profit.

Call `compute_balance_sheet`:
- `date_to`: last day of the month
- `fresh`: true if the user asked for fresh data and you did not already call `clear_cache`

Verify balanced (assets = liabilities + equity).

## Step 6: Summary report

```
Month-End Close: YYYY-MM
================================
Blockers:        X issues
Warnings:        X items
Missing docs:    X invoices
Duplicates:      X found

Trial Balance:   BALANCED / IMBALANCED by X EUR
Balance Sheet:   BALANCED / IMBALANCED
YTD Net Profit:  X.XX EUR

Status: READY TO CLOSE / HAS BLOCKERS
```

If blockers exist, list specific actions needed. Offer to help fix them.
